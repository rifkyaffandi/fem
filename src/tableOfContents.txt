7c8f13c 8. Parcel
    0. Install your parcel by typing npm install -D parcel-bundler (bundler is basically a development catalyst)
    1. go to your script property at your package.json underneath the (blah blah) add the following code  :
        "dev" : "parcel src/index.html"
    2. after that type npm run dev at your terminal. (it will give you the localhost:1234, and then the compiler)

    after you install your parcel, now you can delete your CDN from your index.html(because now the whole thing has been take-cared by parcel)
    Then you should type import React from 'react'; at the very top of your App.js to make sure that you can still have all of those react goodness from parcel.
    After that you should type import { render } from 'react-dom'; underneath your previous statement.
    After that you should export and import your component at your own desired.

    0. Install Node.js. NPM is part of this Node JS.
    1. Initialize npm by typing npm init -y command on your terminal.
    2. Install the formatting first then your linting via terminal using the following commands :
        -- prettier : npm install -D prettier (-D means that you are not installing the standard dependencies but rather the developer dependecies) 
            -- Inside your script property on your package.json, add the following :
                -- "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js, jsx, json, css }\"",
                    -- after that type "npm run format" on your terminal to activate this setting
                -- "format:check": "prettier --list-different \"src/**/*.{js, jsx, json, css }\"",
                    -- after that type "npm run format:check" on your terminal to activate this setting
            -- create a new file called .prettierrc with an empty object in it. (This means that you run the recommended setting from prettier with no modification)
            -- Install Prettier from your VSCode then go to user setting (json) then add :
                "editor.formatOnSave": true and "prettier.requireConfig" : true.
        
        -- ESLint : npm install -D eslint eslint-config-prettier && npm install -D eslint-plugin-prettier
            -- Inside your script property on your package.json, add the following :
                -- "lint": "eslint \"src/**/*.{js, jsx}\"",
                    -- after that type "npm run lint" in your terminal to activate this setting.
                -- Check the devDependencies wheter or not your ESLint is installed yet.
            -- Create a new file called .eslintrc.json with (check the files)
            -- Install ESLint from your VSCode.
            npm run lint -- --debug
